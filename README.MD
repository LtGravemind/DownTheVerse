# Down The 'Verse

Down The 'Verse is a 3rd person space fighter game where you take control of a lone pilot fleeing a evil drone fleet. Fight waves of enemies, race for funds, and lay waste to enemy bosses as you cross the universe. Customize your ship to improve your odds of survival. Take a trip Down The 'Verse.

## Setup

This game prototype was initially developed with Unreal Engine 4.7 and Visual Studio 2013. It has been updated to utilized Unreal Engine 4.10 and Visual Studio 2015.

Setting up the project should be as follows:

1. Download and install the Unreal Engine 4 client. Download the 4.10 package.
2. Download and install Visual Studio 2015.
3. Clone this repository to the folder of your choice.
4. Launch Unreal 4.10 and browse to the folder where you cloned this repository.
5. Click on the .uproject file and go through the setup process.
6. After the client compiles, the editor should open automatically.
7. Click play to launch the game in the editor.
8. Done

Note: Attempting to build the project with a newer version of the engine may result in errors as functions become deprecated. This will need to be fixed before the editor can compile.
